# Welcome to Buoy Finder!
## About:
Buoy Finder is an Android app that allows users to locate SPOT TRACE devices. Users can view the coordinates of their deployed SPOT devices, their distance and heading relative to the devices.

Buoy Finder is useful for a few reasons. First, SPOT's mobile app doesn't use the GPS coordinates of a user's phone, so it can't calculate distance or heading relative to the device. Secondly, Buoy Finder 
is lightweight and can run well on older devices. Lastly, Buoy Finder allows device data to be kept for offline use. For example, when before a user leaves an area will cell coverage they can pull device data and
still see their own location using their phones GPS receiver.

## Getting Started:
Users can get started using the app by downloading it from the 'Releases' section of this repository. Once installed, they can select a device they'd like to view and pull its most recent data, provided they are online.

Here's what that looks like:

*Note: My low-budget Samsung A01 doesn't have a magnetometer or accelerometer. Without these, "Currently Facing" won't show.*

If you find any bugs in the app, please create a new issue describing it.

## Who:

This project is being built and maintained by Ethan Brooks. The project is under the guidance of Omand Lab at University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, whom the app is being developed for. Still, this app is open for anyone's use who needs to track a their SPOT TRACE devices.
